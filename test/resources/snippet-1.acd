=== Creating messages

The first thing to do is to define the messages that clients and servers will
exchange. Since this information is common to both systems we will create a
separate module for holding this information

[source,haskell]
----
<src/Common.hs>=
data Event = Login String
----

[source,bash]
----
<*>=
<src/Common.hs>
